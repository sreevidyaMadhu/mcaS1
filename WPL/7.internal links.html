            <h2 id="intro"><center><u>Introduction</u></center></h2>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">Web technology is a broad term that encompasses all the tools, languages, and protocols used to create and manage websites and web applications. It includes everything from the basic building blocks of the web, such as HTML and CSS, to more advanced technologies like JavaScript, server-side programming, and database management.</p>
            <h2 id="content1"><center><u>Client/server</u></center></h2>
            <center><img src="C:\Users\cacet\OneDrive\Desktop\mca1\WPL\image copy.png" height="300px" width="300px"></center>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">Client-server architecture is a computing model where a central server provides resources and services to multiple client devices (computers, phones, etc.) over a network. Clients request services from the server, which processes these requests and sends back the requested information or performs the requested action. This architecture is fundamental to many internet and network-based applications we use daily, like email, web browsing, online banking, and e-commerce. </p>
            <h2 id="content2"><center><u>Types of web content</u></center></h2>
            <center><img src="C:\Users\cacet\OneDrive\Desktop\mca1\WPL\image copy 2.png"></center>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">Web content can be categorized into several types, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Text:</b> This includes all written content on a webpage, such as articles, blog posts, and product descriptions.</li>
                <li><b>Images:</b> Visual content like photographs, illustrations, and infographics that enhance the user experience.</li>
                <li><b>Videos:</b> Multimedia content that can be embedded in webpages, providing dynamic and engaging information.</li>
                <li><b>Audio:</b> Sound content, including music, podcasts, and voiceovers, that can be played on a webpage.</li>
                <li><b>Interactive content:</b> Elements like quizzes, polls, and games that encourage user participation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="content3"><center><u>Dynamic webpages</u></center></h2>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">Dynamic webpages are web pages that can change their content and layout in response to user interactions or other factors. Unlike static webpages, which display the same information to every visitor, dynamic webpages can provide personalized experiences by retrieving data from databases or other sources. This allows for features like user accounts, real-time updates, and interactive content.</p>

            <h2 id="content4"><center><u>Components of web applications</u></center></h2>
            <center><img src="C:\Users\cacet\OneDrive\Desktop\mca1\WPL\web.png" height="300px" width="500px"></center>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">Web applications are complex systems that consist of several components, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Frontend:</b> The client-side part of the application that users interact with, typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
                <li><b>Backend:</b> The server-side part of the application that processes requests, manages databases, and handles business logic.</li>
                <li><b>Database:</b> A structured collection of data that the application uses to store and retrieve information.</li>
                <li><b>APIs:</b> Application Programming Interfaces that allow different components of the application to communicate with each other and with external services.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="content5"><center><u>HTTP-HTTP requests</u></center></h2>
            <center><img src="C:\Users\cacet\OneDrive\Desktop\mca1\WPL\http.png" height="300px" width="500px"></center>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between clients and servers. When a user interacts with a webpage, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the requested data.HTTP is a protocol. In fact, the acronym stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. This protocol governs the structure and language of the requests and responses that take place between clients and servers. The clients are usually web browsers, but they can come in many forms, such as search engine robots.

When you visit websites through a browser, the entire connection takes place via HTTP. The protocol enables you to receive data, including text, images, videos, stylesheets, scripts, and more.

HTTP has been one of the backbones of the web since the early 90s. In the last decades, it has evolved to become more efficient. The second half of the 2010s saw the development of HTTP/2, which enables clients to load resources simultaneously instead of asynchronously. This results in a massive performance boost.

In 2022, 46 percent of the web is using HTTP/2. Now, there are already discussions about adopting HTTP/3, which is also known as HTTP-over-QUIC. HTTP/3 works with the UDP protocol, which gives it an advantage over traditional TCP connections (which is what HTTP and HTTP/2 use).</p>

            <center><img src="C:\Users\cacet\OneDrive\Desktop\mca1\WPL\appservers.png" height="300px" width="500px"></center>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">Application servers are software frameworks that provide an environment for running web applications. They handle tasks like processing requests, managing sessions, and connecting to databases. Popular application servers include Apache Tomcat, Microsoft IIS, and Nginx.</p>
